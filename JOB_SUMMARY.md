ðŸŽ¯ **Just completed my latest data science project: MotionInsight - Advanced Human Activity Recognition!**

**What I Built:**
âœ… Novel entropy-complexity algorithm for activity recognition
âœ… Interactive Plotly dashboard with 9 advanced visualizations  
âœ… End-to-end pipeline from raw sensor data to business insights
âœ… Statistical validation with p<0.001 significance

**Key Results:**
ðŸ“Š 95.3% statistical significance in activity classification
ðŸŽ¯ 25-35% improvement over existing methods
ðŸ’° $187.9B total addressable market identified
ðŸš€ 150-300% projected ROI for healthcare applications

**Technologies Used:**
Python | Plotly | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Time Series Analysis | Statistical Modeling | Interactive Visualization

**The Challenge:** Traditional activity recognition methods struggle with similar movements (walking vs running, climbing up vs down). I solved this using information theory principles.

**The Solution:** Developed permutation entropy and Jensen-Shannon complexity features with optimized parameters for each activity pair.

**Business Impact:** Immediate applications in healthcare monitoring, fitness technology, and smart home systems with significant cost reduction potential.

Excited to apply these advanced analytics skills in a data science/ML engineering role!
