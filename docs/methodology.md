# üî¨ MotionInsight: Technical Methodology

## Overview

MotionInsight employs a novel entropy-complexity analysis approach to human activity recognition, combining permutation entropy with Jensen-Shannon complexity to create a discriminative feature space for activity classification.

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

### Permutation Entropy Calculation

The permutation entropy (PE) quantifies the complexity of a time series by analyzing the relative frequencies of ordinal patterns:

```
PE(x) = -Œ£ p(œÄ) ln(p(œÄ))
```

Where:
- `x` is the time series
- `œÄ` represents ordinal patterns of dimension `D`
- `p(œÄ)` is the relative frequency of pattern `œÄ`

**Optimal Parameters:**
- Dimension (D): 5
- Delay (œÑ): 2-3 (activity-dependent)

### Jensen-Shannon Complexity

The Jensen-Shannon complexity (C) measures the "statistical complexity" of the probability distribution:

```
C = Q[P] * H[P]
```

Where:
- `Q[P]` is the normalized Jensen-Shannon divergence
- `H[P]` is the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution

## üìä Feature Engineering Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Input**: Raw accelerometer data (3-axis: X, Y, Z)
- **Sampling Rate**: 100 Hz (optimal for human activity recognition)
- **Window Size**: 2.56 seconds (256 samples)
- **Overlap**: 50% (128 samples)

### 2. Entropy-Complexity Calculation
```python
def calculate_entropy_complexity(signal, dimension=5, delay=2):
    """
    Calculate permutation entropy and Jensen-Shannon complexity
    
    Parameters:
    - signal: 1D array of sensor data
    - dimension: embedding dimension for PE calculation
    - delay: time delay for embedding
    
    Returns:
    - pe: permutation entropy
    - complexity: Jensen-Shannon complexity
    """
    # Calculate permutation entropy
    pe = permutation_entropy(signal, dimension, delay)
    
    # Calculate Jensen-Shannon complexity
    complexity = jensen_shannon_complexity(signal, dimension, delay)
    
    return pe, complexity
```

### 3. Feature Space Construction
- **Features**: 2D space (Permutation Entropy, Jensen-Shannon Complexity)
- **Normalization**: Min-max scaling to [0, 1]
- **Dimensionality**: Intentionally low (2D) for interpretability

## üéØ Classification Strategy

### Algorithm Selection
**Random Forest** was selected as the primary classifier due to:
- High performance on entropy-complexity features
- Robust handling of non-linear relationships
- Built-in feature importance calculation
- Resistance to overfitting

### Model Configuration
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    random_state=42
)
```

### Cross-Validation Strategy
- **Method**: 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- **Validation**: Statistical significance testing

## üìà Statistical Validation Framework

### Hypothesis Testing
**Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**: No significant difference in entropy-complexity patterns between activities
**Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**: Significant differences exist between activity patterns

### Statistical Tests Applied
1. **One-Way ANOVA**: Test for significant differences between groups
2. **Post-hoc Tukey HSD**: Pairwise comparison between activities
3. **Effect Size Analysis**: Cohen's d and eta-squared calculations
4. **Confidence Intervals**: 95% confidence bounds for all metrics

### Significance Criteria
- **Œ±-level**: 0.05 (95% confidence)
- **Effect Size Thresholds**: Small (0.01), Medium (0.06), Large (0.14)
- **Power Analysis**: Minimum 80% statistical power

## üîç Activity-Specific Patterns

### Walking Pattern
- **Entropy**: Low (0.754 ¬± 0.080)
- **Complexity**: High (0.214 ¬± 0.045)
- **Interpretation**: Regular, structured movement with predictable patterns

### Running Pattern
- **Entropy**: High (0.813 ¬± 0.125)
- **Complexity**: Low (0.162 ¬± 0.073)
- **Interpretation**: More random, less structured movement patterns

### Climbing Up Pattern
- **Entropy**: Medium-High (0.773 ¬± 0.075)
- **Complexity**: Medium (0.199 ¬± 0.046)
- **Interpretation**: Moderate complexity with controlled randomness

### Climbing Down Pattern
- **Entropy**: Medium-High (0.787 ¬± 0.076)
- **Complexity**: Medium (0.197 ¬± 0.048)
- **Interpretation**: Similar to climbing up with slight variations

## üéØ Performance Optimization

### Parameter Tuning
Optimal parameters were determined through systematic grid search:

| Parameter | Walking vs Running | Climbing Up vs Down |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Dimension | 5 | 4 |
| Delay | 2 | 3 |
| Window Size | 2.56s | 2.56s |

### Feature Selection
- **Permutation Entropy**: 50.7% importance
- **Jensen-Shannon Complexity**: 49.3% importance
- **Balanced Contribution**: Both features equally important

## üî¨ Validation Results

### Statistical Significance
- **Permutation Entropy**: F(3,176) = 3.29, p = 0.022, Œ∑¬≤ = 0.053
- **Complexity**: F(3,176) = 7.39, p < 0.001, Œ∑¬≤ = 0.112

### Classification Performance
- **Overall Accuracy**: 39.4% (significantly above 25% random chance)
- **Best Pairwise**: Running vs Climbing Down (60.7%)
- **Cross-Validation**: Consistent performance across all folds

### Effect Sizes
- **Cohen's d (Walking vs Running)**: 0.856 (Large effect)
- **Cohen's d (Climbing Up vs Down)**: 0.034 (Small effect)
